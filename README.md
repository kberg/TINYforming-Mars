# TINYforming Mars
An online implementation of the PnP game [TINYforming Mars](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/282493/tinyforming-mars)

There is no code yet. I'm working on an initial commit, but subscribe to this repo if you want updates.

## Project goals

The goal is to faithfully recreate the game TINYforming Mars online. As it is a generally feature-limited game compared to its big sister Terraforming Mars, faithful recreation is probably doable. This will implement the edition where card are NOT double-sided, and instead are drawn from a deck.

Besides the original game, I endeavor to include these features:
*  milestones
*  awards
*  corps
*  the few fan corps
*  optional set-up
*  solo play

And that's it. Once those work, I do not have any plans to continue expanding with new corps or cards. What happens then is anybody's guess, but hopefully the app will be alive and well, and anyone can fork the repository, anyway.

I will not be prioritizing internationalization, but if anyone wants to talk about it, please contact me.

Thanks!
